# XMLdata
These are stand-alone XML files containing data useful for dropdown menus or other references. Feel free to edit and reuse without attribution.
For example, I have a list of currencies, to include their symbols, common abbreviations, and full names. There is another file with a list of countries and areas of special sovereignty, along with two-letter abbreviations. There is a list of languages in English and in the native language (and alphabet). And so on. All files are stand-alone and are provided simply to save you time.
